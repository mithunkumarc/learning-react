#### why hooks :

        with hooks, extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently
        and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component
        hierarchy. This makes it easy to share hooks among many components or with community



        Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related 
        (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data),
